# Text Analytics Course Projects

This repository contains various projects developed during the Text Analytics course by a group of four students. The primary focus of these projects is to implement and experiment with different machine learning models for Sentiment Analysis and Part of Speech (POS) Tagging tasks. The models explored include Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Transformers (BERT).

## Projects Overview

### 1. Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis involves determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text. The goal is to classify the text as positive, negative, or neutral. This repository includes implementations of several models to perform sentiment analysis:

- **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**: A simple feedforward neural network that consists of multiple layers of neurons.
- **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**: A neural network that is well-suited for sequential data and can capture temporal dependencies.
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: A neural network typically used for image data, but here adapted to extract features from text sequences.
- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**: A state-of-the-art transformer model that leverages a deep bidirectional representation of text.

### 2. Part of Speech (POS) Tagging
POS tagging is the process of assigning a part of speech to each word in a sentence, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc. The projects in this repository also cover different approaches to POS tagging:

- **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**: Used to classify each word into its corresponding part of speech.
- **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**: Captures the context of words in a sentence to make more accurate predictions.
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Extracts local features from the sequence of words to predict their parts of speech.
- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**: Utilizes deep contextualized embeddings for precise POS tagging.

## Project Structure

Each project folder contains:
- **Data Preprocessing Scripts**: Scripts to clean and prepare the data for model training.
- **Model Implementation**: Code for building and training the respective models.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Scripts to evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Results and Analysis**: Jupyter notebooks and scripts for visualizing and analyzing the results.
