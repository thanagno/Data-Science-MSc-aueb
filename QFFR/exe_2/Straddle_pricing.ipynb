    "\n",
    "Assume a stock the process of which follows a Geometric Brownian Motion. The current stock price S(0) is equal to $20, with an annual volatility of returns of 35%. If the risk-free rate is equal to 3% and the dividend yield is equal to 1.5%, find the price of an American-style At-The-Money Straddle (Long Put and Long Call), with an expiry of 6 months. Find also the stock (delta) and volatility (vega) sensitivities, with the help of your function.\n",

    "### Report on Pricing an American and European Straddle\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "A straddle is an options strategy that involves buying both a call and a put option with the same strike price and expiration date. Here we price an American-style at-the-money straddle using a binomial tree model and a European-style at-the-money straddle using a Monte Carlo simulation. Additionally, we discuss the delta and vega sensitivities of the American straddle.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters and Assumptions\n",
    "- **Current Stock Price (S0)**: 20USD\n",
    "- **Strike Price (K)**: 20USD\n",
    "- **Time to Expiry (T)**: 6 months (0.5 years)\n",
    "- **Risk-Free Rate (r)**: 3%\n",
    "- **Dividend Yield (q)**: 1.5%\n",
    "- **Volatility (sigma)**: 35%\n",

    "#### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "##### American Straddle Pricing using Binomial Tree\n",
    "1. **Binomial Tree Construction**: \n",
    "   - We set up the binomial price tree for the underlying stock. The stock price at each node is calculated based on the up and down factors (`u` and `d`) derived from the volatility and time step.\n",
    "   - The probability of moving up in the tree is calculated using the risk-neutral probability formula.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Option Valuation**:\n",
    "   - We initialize the option value tree by calculating the payoff at expiration for both the call and the put options.\n",
    "   - We then work backwards through the tree, calculating the option value at each node by considering the possibility of early exercise (since these are American options)."

    "The binomial tree and Monte Carlo methods provided effective ways to price American and European straddles respectively. The higher price of the American straddle reflects the added value of early exercise flexibility. The sensitivity analysis showed that the straddle is more responsive to changes in volatility than to changes in the underlying stock price, aligning with the characteristics of a straddle strategy that profits from significant price movements regardless of direction."
